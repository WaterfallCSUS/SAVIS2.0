SAVIS is an educational tool to help to intuitively understand concepts of tests of statistical hypotheses using visualizations based on resampling and randomization techniques. SAVIS has an online and a stand-alone version (both freely available) in English and Spanish.","content2":"SAVIS was created in the Spring of 2019 by the following group of graduating seniors from the Department of Computer Science at CSUS under the direction of Rafael E.
