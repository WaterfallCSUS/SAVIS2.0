===== SAVIS =====
Statistical Analysis Visualizations for Introductory Statistics (SAVIS) was conceived as part of a collaborative research project on statistical education between the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University Sacramento (CSUS) and the School of Mathematics of the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán (UADY). SAVIS is an educational tool to help to intuitively understand concepts of tests of statistical hypotheses using visualizations based on resampling and randomization techniques. SAVIS has an online and a stand-alone version (both freely available) in English and Spanish.
